Type Wars is a Star Wars themed typing game. I wrote it with [Nabeelah Ali](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/nabeelah-ali/54/549/a3b) for a course on programming languages. It was written in [Clojure] (http://clojure.org/).

Clojure is very convenient as although it is relatively new it is very flexible, partly since it provides access to Java frameworks which we took advantage of. 

{% highlight js %}

(import '(java.applet Applet)
        '(java.io File)
        '(java.net URL))

{% endhighlight %}

Easy as that.

Once I had a co-worker laughing at me for using [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell) as it is a purely-functional language which to him meant immutable states or in other words, it is impossible to work with. Clojure saves me from future mockery as, although a functional language it does allow for mutable states. This is done through what they call `atom`s.

{% highlight js %}

(set-state! :score        (atom 0)
            :typed        (atom "")
            :game         (atom '())
            :words        (atom (get-lines wordfile))
            :missedwords  (atom 0)
            :ended        (atom -1)
            :quotesw      (atom (get-star-wars-quote))
)

{% endhighlight %}

These states are then altered when the gameplay begins.
