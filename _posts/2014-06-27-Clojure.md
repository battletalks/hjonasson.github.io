title: Type Wars

Type Wars is a game I wrote with [Nabeelah Ali](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/nabeelah-ali/54/549/a3b) for a course on programming languages. It was written in [Clojure] (http://clojure.org/).

Clojure is very convenient as although it is relatively new, it provides access to Java frameworks which we took advantage of. 

{% highlight js %}

(import '(java.applet Applet)
        '(java.io File)
        '(java.net URL))

{% endhighlight %}

Easy as that.

Once I had a co-worker laughing at me for using [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell) as it is a purely-functional language which to him meant immutable states. Clojure saves me from future mockery as, although a functional language it does allow for mutable states through what they call `atom`s.
